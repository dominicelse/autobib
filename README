====== Installation instructions (Mac/Linux): =======

Install python3. On Ubuntu/Debian, also install the python3-venv package.

In the directory containing this file, run:
$ ./make_env

Now copy bin/imbibe into $PATH somewhere.

Then you can invoke the command by
running
$ imbibe [INPUTFILE] >[OUTPUTFILE]


===== Installation instructions (Windows) ======

Install Python 3, e.g. from the following link:

https://www.python.org/downloads/

When running the installer, make sure to select the "Add Python to PATH" option.
If you already have Python installed (e.g. using the Anaconda distribution), this
is fine as long as the Python executables are in your PATH.

Run the "make_env_windows.bat" file in this directory. Among other things, this will
create a file called "imbibehere.bat". Copy this file into the directory containing
the "refs.txt" for your TeX project. Now you can run this command (e.g. by
double-clicking in your file manager) to generate the refs-autobib.bib file
from "refs.txt"


====== Syntax for the input files: =======

Each line should be of one of the following forms
xxxx.yyyyy
xxxx.yyyyy [opt1:value, opt2:value, ...]
doi:zzzzz
doi:zzzzz [opt1:value, opt2:value, ...]

Where xxxx.yyyyy is an arxiv ID.
    (can also be an old-style ID like "cond-mat/xxxxxx")
doi:zzzzz is a DOI.
You can specify the following options in the [...]:
    doi:zzzzz
       If you specified an arXiv ID, but the DOI linked to it on arXiv is
       incorrect or not present.
    bibtex_id:theidyouwant
       If you want to override the default BibTeX ID which imbibe generates.
       Note that for the moment imbibe only generates a default ID if you
       specify the paper by arXiv ID. If you specify by DOI then you must use
       this option to set the BibTeX ID.
