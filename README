====== Installation instructions (Linux): =======

Install python3. On Ubuntu/Debian, also install the python3-venv package.

In the directory containing this file, run:
$ ./make_env

Now copy bin/imbibe into $PATH somewhere.

Then you can invoke the command by
running
$ imbibe [INPUTFILE] [OUTPUTFILE]


====== Installation instructions (Mac): =======

Install Python 3, for example from this link:
https://www.python.org/downloads/

If you already have Python installed (e.g. using the Anaconda distribution), this
is fine as long as the Python executables are in your PATH.

You can either follow the same instructions as for Linux above, or
(for a more GUI-friendly approach):

Double-click the "make_env.command" file in Finder.

This will, among other things, create a file called "imbibehere.command"
Copy this file into the directory containing the "refs.txt" for your TeX project.

Now you can run this command (e.g. by double-clicking in Finder) to generate the
refs-autobib.bib file from refs.txt


===== Installation instructions (Windows) ======

Install Python 3, e.g. from the following link:

https://www.python.org/downloads/

When running the installer, make sure to select the "Add Python to PATH" option.
If you already have Python installed (e.g. using the Anaconda distribution), this
is fine as long as the Python executables are in your PATH.

Run the "make_env_windows.bat" file in this directory. Among other things, this will
create a file called "imbibehere.bat". Copy this file into the directory containing
the "refs.txt" for your TeX project. Now you can run this command (e.g. by
double-clicking in your file manager) to generate the refs-autobib.bib file
from "refs.txt"


====== Syntax for the input files: =======

Each line should be of one of the following forms
xxxx.yyyyy
xxxx.yyyyy [opt1:value, opt2:value, ...]
doi:zzzzz
doi:zzzzz [opt1:value, opt2:value, ...]

Where xxxx.yyyyy is an arxiv ID.
    (can also be an old-style ID like "cond-mat/xxxxxx")
doi:zzzzz is a DOI.
You can specify the following options in the [...]:
    doi:zzzzz
       If you specified an arXiv ID, but the DOI linked to it on arXiv is
       incorrect or not present.
    bibtex_id:theidyouwant
       If you want to override the default BibTeX ID which imbibe generates.
       Note that for the moment imbibe only generates a default ID if you
       specify the paper by arXiv ID. If you specify by DOI then you must use
       this option to set the BibTeX ID.
   suppress_volumewarning:yes|no (default: no)
       Occasionally you run across papers whose bibliographic data does not
       contain journal volume information. In this case, by default imbibe will process
       this entry but spit out a warning. Setting suppress_volumewarning:yes
       will prevent the warning from being generated for this entry.
   origcase:yes|no|auto (default:auto)
       Setting origcase:yes causes the title field in the BibTeX file for this
       paper to be surrounded with {{ and }}. This has the effect of preventing
       BibTeX from converting the title to lower case when it generates the
       bibliography. Setting origcase:auto will cause imbibe to attempt to guess
       whether the journal title is using "title capitalization" or not; if so,
       it chooses origcase:no; otherwise, it chooses origcase:yes.
   comment:text
       If specified, imbibe will add the text to the BibTeX file above the entry
       for this paper, as a "comment". Note that if you want this text to
       contain one of the following characters: \:,[] you should escape them,
       e.g. replace "Hello, World!" with "Hello\, World!"
   options:value
   addendum:value
       If one of these is specified, then imbibe will create an "options"
       or "addendum" field for this entry in the BibTeX file with the specified
       value. Special characters should be escaped as for the "comment" option.
       To allow for other options which get translated directly to BibTeX
       fields, copy the imbibe/opts_default.py file to imbibe/opts.py and then
       edit the imbibe/opts.py file as desired.
       

===== Other notes =======

* When run, imbibe creates a cache file called "imbibe-cache.json". If you want
  to automatically bring in new information for the cited references (for
  example, an arXiv paper that now has a published DOI associated with it), then
  delete this file and run imbibe again.

* In order to get correct output of author names and titles containing non-Ascii
  characters, you will need to add the line
  
      \usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}
  
  to your LaTeX file.
